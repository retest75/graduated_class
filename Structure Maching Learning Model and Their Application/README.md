# Introduction

In this folder, it include my project implement of graduated class .

This class name is Structure Machine Learning Model and Their Application, in this class, we must **read two papers** and **reproduce their experiments.**

# About this project

Both of these paper are **fire dectection**, In implement_1, it use VGG-16 and ResNet-50 to operate transfer learning but **modified their architectures** in fully connect layer. In implement_2 it use GoogLeNet, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and EfficientNetB0 as pretrained model, however, add a **attention mechanism** to raise it performance, then use **Grad-CAM** to observe its result.

Ultimately, I compare these experiment by **confusion matrix** and evaluate which one is better.

# Reference

1. If you have **interesting** about this work , you can send a mail for [me](fk0963@gmail.com) and I will give you my dataset about fire dataset

2. The PDF file is my final report.
