# Introduction

This folder include all of my practice about **PyTorch**, my reference book is **PyTorch 開發者傳授秘笈**, 

its publisher is **智深出版社**.

# Content

Chap.03 include several exercise like **tensor**, **auto derivative** and **basic fully connect layer**.

Chap.04 will implement a **simple classifier** by MNIST dataset.

Chap.05 include some basic image process and transform, then will construct some **customized datasets** by three different methods.

Chap.06 implement a classifier by MNIST dataset again, but add a **convolutional layer** in here.

Chap.07 about pre-trained model and **transfer learning**.

Chap.08 is **Object detection**, but I haven't implement.

Chap.09 include several self-supervised learning like **AutoEncoder** and its variation, then pratice **U-Net** by open dataset about fundus.
